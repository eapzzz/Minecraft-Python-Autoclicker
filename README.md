## 📁 How It Works

This script uses:  
- `pyautogui` to simulate mouse clicks  
- `keyboard` to listen for keypresses  
- `random` to add delay randomness (to avoid detection)  

It runs an **infinite loop**, constantly checking:  
1. If you're paused or not  
2. If not paused — it clicks, waits a random delay, and repeats  
3. You can **toggle pause** with the `'` key  

It does **not** require Minecraft modding or injections — works externally like a macro.
